TODO POINTS FOR TOMORROW LAST CHANCE+
+Ditch the exponential interpolation - just use the interpolation we have
+Add a way for server to correct client position when predicting
    state comes in
    check the state against our state from that time
    if it differs more than a certain amount, warp back
    and replay inputs
    need to save all state+input at each step
    delete state+input once it's been oked
+chat log with text entry
+be able to warp mobs
    (flag a state as a full non-interpolated state)
+mobs have different appearances based on the name entered
+change mob appearance in-world

tutorial on how the simple game works


having a somewhat synced server time would be nice, especially for client prediction
    we get players position, know it was at a set time
    we can check in the past where player was at that time
    if they differ we can correct

standard protocol for changing client update rate
	server can be confugired to adjust for lag
	client can force/request a certain value

our mobs have interpolation on by default - no way to warp them

input is pretty hacked up right now
	no easy hooks for making your own input system
	needs finer time tuning within an input message

    at time t0
    we move right
    client t0 move right
    server gets t0
    server moves to t1
    client at time t1
    we move left
    we get t0 ack
    its ok
    we send t1 movement
    server gets t1
    moves left
    sends t1 ack
    client gets t1 ack
    still ok
